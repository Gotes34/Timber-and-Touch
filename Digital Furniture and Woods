Space Organization Creation Repository: Market Research Using Jira Tool
In the competitive landscape of the furniture industry, Timber and Touch recognizes the critical need for a structured approach to space organization creation. This initiative involves the development of a
comprehensive repository that consolidates market research findings relevant to space organization trends, 
consumer preferences, and emerging technologies. Using Jira as a project management tool, the team can efficiently track tasks, assign responsibilities, and collaborate on research insights.
The project begins with identifying key market segments and customer demographics, employing surveys and interviews
to gather qualitative data on how consumers utilize space in their homes. The repository will catalog this information, 
including visual aids, product specifications, and competitor analyses, to create a robust knowledge base that informs design and marketing strategies.
Jira facilitates the organization of this project by allowing team members to create tasks related to data collection, 
analysis, and presentation. Each task can be assigned deadlines, and team members can attach relevant documents or links, 
ensuring that all resources are easily accessible. Additionally, the tool’s reporting features will help track progress and measure the impact
of the research on product development and sales strategies.
Overall, this project aims to enhance Timber and Touch’s offerings by providing insightful, data-driven recommendations for space organization solutions, 
ultimately improving customer satisfaction and driving sales growth. By utilizing Jira effectively, the team can ensure a streamlined process that aligns with the company's innovative visions
